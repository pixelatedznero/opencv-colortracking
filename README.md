# Colortracking using OpenCV

A beginners try on colortracking in OpenCV. Neither optemised or well coded, but it works sometimes!

## Explination

> 01-basic.py
- Very basic colortracking using a fixed color range in HSV

> 02-highlight.py
- Added hightlighting of the biggest detected contour + display of its center coordinates

> 03-change_color.py
- Added posibility to change the color range by clicking the color in the window

> 04-mouse_and_color.py
- Added small square to see what colors are detected when clicked
- Added big colored circle to show the color that would be detected now

> 05-morphology.py
- Added morphology for smoother detection
