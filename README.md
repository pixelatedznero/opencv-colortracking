# Colortracking using OpenCV

A beginners try on colortracking in OpenCV. Neither optemised or well coded, but it works sometimes!

## Explination

> 01-basic.py
Very basic colortracking using a fixed color range in HSV

> 02-highlight.py
Added hightlight of the biggest detected contour and adding its center coordinates

> 03-change_color.py
Added posibility to change the color range by clicking the color in the window

> 04-mouse_and_color.py
small square to se what colors are detected and big colored circle to show the color now

> 05-morphology.py
added morphology for smoother detection
